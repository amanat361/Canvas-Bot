# Hi, I'm Canvas Bot!
## _Welcome to a new kind of Discord Bot_

Canvas Bot is an open source project with the goal of creating an easy to use skeleton for Discord bots that interact with the Canvas API. This bot has plenty more features that are currently not available on the public repository. These features will be added as they are completed to give a more complex and practical use out of the bot. The current features are listed below. This bot uses a mix of different methods for parsing, decoding, and embedding messages with data from Canvas courses that can be beneficial for students in their classes' Discord servers.

## Features

- Access all of the items in a specified module
- Return a link to a specific assignment or module item
- Include a fun programming quote in the embed

## Future Features
- Fetch and process data for announcements
- Remind students of upcoming assingment deadlines
- Register users on the server to access their own data
- Submit assignments based on users
- Play games with users and various fun commands

## Assembly Bot
This bot is a snipped from a larger project, Assembly Bot
Assembly Bot can do a lot of cool things, here are a few examples.
- Manipulate the general purpose registeers EAX, EBX, ECX, and EDX
- Create and store variables with MASM x86 dword syntax
- Do hexadecimal and binary math operations
- Convert between decimal, hexadecimal, and binary
- MOV, ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, with the registers, variables, and hex values
- Play a guessing game with hex numbers
- Automatically detect, parse, format, and return a modified version of assembly code
- Much much more

Eventually, Assembly Bot will have its own page once the code has been cleaned up and all features in progress have been added. Assembly Bot also can do everything Canvas Bot does. Since mose users of this open source project don't need to do math between registers, all of that code has been removed for the purposes of this repository.

## Requirements
The bot uses the following Python libraries:
- canvasapi
- json
- discord
- wikiquote
- urllib.request
- os

## Installation
Just fill in the placeholder text on the Python script and run!
No fancy coding necessary, it's all built into one runnable Python file.
You do need to have a Discord bot though to attatch this code to.
The only prerequisite data the bot will require are as follows:
- Canvas API Token
- Canvas URL (to your specific school)
- Discord Bot Token

## Development

Stay tuned for updates on how to contribute!
